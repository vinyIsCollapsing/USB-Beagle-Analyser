# USB-Beagle-Analyser
This project is a C++ program designed to parse and analyze CSV files generated by the Total Phase Data Center Analyzer for USB protocols.
The goal is to extract the most important aspects of USB communication—such as critical transactions, error events, and timing anomalies—to assist engineers and developers in debugging and optimizing their systems.

Key Features:

    CSV Parsing: Reads and interprets CSV files exported from the Total Phase Data Center Analyzer.
    Data Analysis: Filters and groups USB transactions to identify critical events, errors, and communication patterns.
