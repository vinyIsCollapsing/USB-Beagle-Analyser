# USB-Beagle-Analyser
This project is a C++ program designed to parse and analyze CSV files generated by the Total Phase Data Center Analyzer for USB protocols.
The goal is to extract the most important aspects of USB communication—such as critical transactions, error events, and timing anomalies—to assist engineers and developers in debugging and optimizing their systems.

Key Features:

    CSV Parsing: Reads and interprets CSV files exported from the Total Phase Data Center Analyzer.
    Data Analysis: Filters and groups USB transactions to identify critical events, errors, and communication patterns.

## Building the Project

To build the project, open a terminal in the root directory of the repository and run:

```bash
make
```

This command will:

    Compile the source files located in the src/ directory.
    Generate object files in the obj/ directory.
    Create the final executable in the bin/ directory (for example, named usb_analyzer).

## Cleaning Generated Files

If you want to remove the generated build files (the bin/ and obj/ directories), run:

```bash
make clean
```

This command deletes the build directories and files, keeping your repository clean.

## Running the application

After building, the executable will be located in the bin/ directory. To run the program, use:

```bash
./bin/usb-analyzer
```
